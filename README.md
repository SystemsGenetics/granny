GRANNY is a Python-based implementation of Mask-RCNN and image segmentation technique to generate ratings for superficial disorders in "Granny Smith" apples. 

## Introduction 

Superficial scald is a physiological disorder that occurs following a chilling injury during early weeks of fruit storage, but with delayed symptom development - most notably peel necrosis that occurs in irregular patterns. Currently, quantification of the superficial scald incidence is performed manually by trained technicians, often using a small set of rating values. Human error and individual bias, and the coarse-grained rating scale can lead to inconsistencies in estimation of disorder severity.
