Developer's Guide
=================

Granny is designed following a Model-Viewer-Controller (MVC) style framework and is designed to allow other software developers with Python programming expertise to add new "pluggable" modules that can provide new interfaces, storage backends, rating modules, and output formats.  An open Application Programming Interface (API) will be made available here in a future release of the software to assist developers in creation of those modules.
