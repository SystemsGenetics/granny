In the collaboration with `Honaas lab 
<https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/wenatchee-wa/physiology-and-pathology-of-tree-fruits-research/people/loren-honaas/>`_
at the USDA Agricultural Research Service, the `Ficklin Research Program <http://ficklinlab.cahnrs.wsu.edu/>`_ at Washington State University has developed **Granny**, an image analysis software that uses an instance segmentation algorithm to identify individual fruit in photos, and then process the images to extract individual fruit sub-images and remove the background for downstream analyses. **Granny**, aiming to assist in post-harvest fruit maturity index experiments, generates useful results from RGB images for determining superficial disorders and maturity in many apple and pear cultivars.
