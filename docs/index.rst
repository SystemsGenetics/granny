Granny
======

**Granny** is going to rate your fruits!

**Granny** is an image analysis software that uses an instance segmentation algorithm to identify individual fruit in
photos, and then process the images to extract individual fruit sub-images and remove the background for downstream
analyses, aiming to assist in post-harvest fruit maturity index experiments. **Granny** generates useful results from
RGB images for determining superficial disorders and maturity in many apples and pears cultivars.
